Superradiance amplification factors for bosonic waves scattered off a Kerr black hole.
[Black-hole superradiance: from fundamental physics to astrophysics,  R. Brito, V. Cardoso, P. Pani (2015)]

Format:
#1: black hole spin, $a/M$
#2: frequency of the wave, $\omega M$ 
#3: amplification factor, $dEout/dEin-1$, where d(Eout)/dt and d(Ein)/dt are the energy fluxes of outgoing and ingoing radiation , respectively.


Notes:

i) When $m \neq 0$, the range in $\omega$ extends from $-m\Omega_H$ to $+m\Omega_H$, where $\Omega_H$ is the angular velocity of a zero-angular momentum observer at the black-hole horizon, as measured by a static observer at infinity.

ii) Due to the symmetry $Z_{slm}(\omega)=Z_{sl-m}(-\omega)$, it is sufficient to consider only positive frequencies.

iii) The number of digits in the tables is not indicative of the precision; our tests indicate a precision of one part in $10^5$.
