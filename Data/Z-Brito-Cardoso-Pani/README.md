## Superradiance amplification factors for bosonic waves scattered off a Kerr black hole.


### Reference:
- Black-hole superradiance: from fundamental physics to astrophysics,  R. Brito, V. Cardoso, P. Pani (2015)

### Format (columns):
1. Black hole spin, *a/M*
2. Frequency of the wave, *ω M* 
3. Amplification factor *Z*, *dEout/dEin-1*, where *d(Eout)/dt* and *d(Ein)/dt* are the energy fluxes of outgoing and ingoing radiation, respectively.


#### Notes:

- When *m≠0*, the range in ω extends from *-m Ω_H* to *+m Ω_H*, where *Ω_H* is the angular velocity of a zero-angular momentum observer at the black-hole horizon, as measured by a static observer at infinity.

- Due to the symmetry *Z_{s,l,m}(ω)=Z_{s,l,-m}(-ω)*, it is sufficient to consider only positive frequencies.

- The number of digits in the tables is not indicative of the precision; our tests indicate a precision of one part in _10^5_.
