\section{Introduction}

The first direct observation of gravitational waves (GWs) by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) was in 2015 and later announced in 2016.
The recorded event matched the predictions of General Relativity (GR) for a binary system of black holes (BHs) merging together in an inward spiral into a single BH \cite{Abbott2016}.
These observations demonstrated not only the existence of GWs but also existence of binary stellar-mass BH systems and that these systems could merge in a time less than the known Universe age.
Since then, two more similar events were detected, which assured the inauguration of a new era of GW cosmology. 

Naturally, this sparked new interest in the study of binary systems and GW-related phenomena.
One of these phenomena is the possibility of amplification in waves scattered off rotating and/or charged BHs, which can occur under certain conditions for scalar, electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational bosonic waves.
Such effect is one of many that encompass a wide range of phenomena generally known as \emph{superradiance}.
In this work, we aim to study in detail the effects of superradiance for EM waves scattering off rotating BHs, paving the way for future observational studies of this phenomenon.

Historically, the first appearance of the concept of superradiance appeared in 1954, in a publication by Dicke \cite{Dicke1954}.
Almost two decades later, Zel'dovich \cite{Zeldovich1971,Zeldovich1972} showed that an absorbing cylinder rotating with an angular velocity $\Omega$ could amplify an incident wave, $\psi \sim e^{-i \omega t + i m \phi}$, with frequency $\omega$ if
\begin{align}
    \omega < m\, \Omega
    \label{eq1:superradiance}
\end{align}
were satisfied, where $m$ is the usual azimuthal number of the monochromatic plane wave relative to the rotation axis.
In his work, he noticed that superradiance was related with dissipation of rotational energy from the absorbing object, possibly due to spontaneous pair creation at the surface. 
Hawking later showed \cite{Hawking1974} that the presence of strong electromagnetic or gravitational fields could indeed generate bosonic and fermionic pairs spontaneously.
This result was possible by the efforts of Starobinsky and Deruelle \cite{Starobinsky1973a,Starobinsky1973b,Deruelle1974,Deruelle1975}, which also laid the groundwork necessary for the discovery of BH evaporation.

Among other possible cases of radiation amplification, the phenomena worked out throughout this work is an example of \emph{rotational superradiance}. 
As the name suggests, it occurs in the presence of ``rotating'' objects, as is the famous example of Zel'dovich cylinder.
The condition \eqref{eq1:superradiance} also appears in the context of general relativity, but in this case $\Omega$ represents the angular velocity of a Kerr BH event horizon.
This geometry is the simplest solution for a static but non-stationary BH, which breaks spherical symmetry. 
%Among many other features of the Kerr BH,
In \cref{Chapter2} we describe many features of the Kerr BH, the most important for this work being the existence of an \emph{ergoregion} where is possible for an infalling particle (or wave) to have negative energy \cite{Wald2010} when measured by a static observer in asymptotic flat space.
As a result, under certain conditions it is possible for a particle to extract energy from the BH through the \emph{Penrose process} \cite{Townsend1997}, which is a counterpart to wave amplification.

In the case of superradiance, it is was shown by Teukolsky that all types of wave perturbations propagating in the Kerr background are described using the same master equation \cite{Teukolsky1972,Teukolsky1973a}.
This generalization is only possible by recurring to the Newman-Pensore (NP) formalism, which is a form of spinor calculus in GR \cite{Newman1962}, introduced in \cref{Chapter3}.
Certain modes in bosonic waves (scalar, electromagnetic, gravitational) can be amplified while others are partially or totally absorbed by the BH. Also, it can be shown that fermionic waves cannot be amplified \cite{Brito2015}.
Therefore we will focus primarily on EM waves in the case of a neutral rotating BH, which needs less algebraic computations to achieve to the same master equation.
However, this study provides a close parallel to the gravitational case as it provides insight to the same physical process.

The effects of superradiance can be computed for each mode by solving the radial part of Teukolsky's equation using approximate analytical methods \cite{Starobinsky1973a,Starobinsky1973b}.
Since no other analytical methods that solve this problem have been found, the only other way of tackling the problem is by taking a numerical approach. All steps necessary to implement this method are explained in detail in \cref{Chapter4}, including some results.

In \cref{Chapter5} it is addressed a we address the scattering of EM plane waves. 
Plane waves are a composition superposition of harmonic modes that are scattered independently by the black hole, with different amplification/absorption factors and phase-shifts. We discuss how these different effects add up in the overall scattered wave.

We summarize and make an overall appreciation of our results and conclusions in \cref{Chapter6}, along with discussing the prospects for future observational tests of black hole superradiance.

\section{Klein paradox as a first example}

Radiation amplification can be traced to the birth of Quantum Mechanics, in the beginning of the 20th century. 
First studies of the Dirac equation by Klein \cite{Klein1929} revealed the possibility of electrons propagating in a region with a sufficiently large potential barrier without the expected dampening from non-relativistic tunnel effect.
Due to some confusion, this result was wrongly interpreted by some authors as fermionic superradiance, as if the current reflected by the barrier could be greater than the incident current. 
The problem was named \emph{Klein paradox} by Sauter \cite{Sauter1931} and this misleading result was due to an incorrect calculation of the group velocities of the reflected and transmitted waves. 

Today, it is known that fermionic currents cannot be amplified for this particular problem \cite{Manogue1988,Klein1929}, a result that was correctly obtained by Klein in is original paper. 
On the contrary, superradiant scattering can indeed occur for bosonic fields.

\subsection{Bosons}

The equation that governs bosonic wave function is the Klein-Gordon equation, which for a minimally coupled electromagnetic potential takes the form
\begin{align}
    (D^\nu D_\nu - \mu^2) \Phi = 0 ~,
    \label{eq1:KleinGordon}
\end{align}
where the usual partial derivative becomes $D_\nu \equiv \partial_\nu + i e A_\nu$ and $\mu$ is the boson mass.

The problem is greatly simplified by considering flat space-time in (1+1)-dimensions and a step potential $A_t(x) = V\,\theta(x)$, for constant $V>0$ and wave solutions $\Phi= e^{-i \omega t} \phi$.
For $x<0$, the solution can be divided as incident and reflected, taking the form
\begin{align}
    \phi_\mathrm{inc}(x) = \mathscr{I}\, e^{i k x}  ~, \qquad
    \phi_\mathrm{refl}(x) = \mathscr{R}\, e^{- i k x} ~,
    \label{eq1:KGsolneg}
\end{align}
in which the dispersion relation states that $k=\sqrt{\omega^2-\mu^2}$. For $x>0$, the transmitted wave is naturally given by 
\begin{align}
    \psi_\mathrm{inc}(x) = \mathscr{T}\, e^{i q x}  ~,
    \label{eq1:KGsolpos}
\end{align}
but in this case the root sign for the momentum must be carefully chosen so that the group velocity sign of the transmitted wave matches that of the incoming wave \cite{Manogue1988}, \textit{i.e.}
\begin{align}
    \left.\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial p}\right|_{p=q} = \frac{q}{\omega - e V} > 0 ~,
    \label{eq1:KGphasev}
\end{align}
therefore we must have that
\begin{align}
    q = \mathrm{sgn}(\omega - e V) \sqrt{ (\omega - e V)^2 - \mu^2 } ~.
    \label{eq1:KGq}
\end{align}

After obtaining the continuity relations at the barrier, $x=0$, we follow by computing the ratios of the transmitted and reflected currents relative to the incident one, which yield
\begin{align}
    \frac{j_\mathrm{refl}}{j_\mathrm{inc}} = - \left|\frac{\mathscr{R}}{\mathscr{I}}\right|^2 = -\left|\frac{1-r}{1+r}\right|^2  ~, \qquad \frac{j_\mathrm{trans}}{j_\mathrm{inc}} = \Re(r) \left|\frac{\mathscr{T}}{\mathscr{I}}\right|^2 = \frac{4\, \Re(r)}{|1+r|^2} ~,
    \label{eq1:KGcurrents}
\end{align}
written as a function of the coefficient 
\begin{align}
    r = \frac{q}{k} = \mathrm{sgn}(\omega - e V)  \sqrt{\frac{(\omega - e V)^2 - \mu^2}{\omega^2 - \mu^2}} ~.
    \label{eq1:KGr}
\end{align}
Hence, in the case of strong potential limit, $e V > \omega + \mu > 2 \mu$, we may have $r<0$ real and the reflected current is larger (in magnitude) than the incident wave and therefore we have amplification.

\subsection{Fermions}

Dirac noticed that the Klein-Gordon equation masked internal degrees of freedom, so he devised his own equation which describes fermions.
Considering that scalar potentials do not have any impact on spin orientation \cite{Itzykson2012}, we need only to consider half of the spinor components in the Dirac equation
\begin{align}
    ( i \gamma^\nu D_\nu - \mu ) \Psi = 0 ~,
    \label{eq1:Dirac}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the fermion mass, for which a valid representation of the gamma matrices is
\begin{align}
    \gamma^0 = \left(\begin{array}{cr} 1 & 0 \\  0 & -1 \end{array}\right) ~,\qquad 
    \gamma^1 = \left(\begin{array}{cr} 0 & 1 \\ -1 &  0 \end{array}\right) ~.
    \label{eq1:Gamma1+1}
\end{align}
Probing wave solutions $\Psi= e^{-i\omega t} \psi$, the incident and reflected solutions are
\begin{align}
    \psi_\mathrm{inc}(x) = \mathscr{I}\, e^{i k x} \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ \cfrac{k}{\omega+\mu} \end{array}\right) ~,\qquad
    \psi_\mathrm{refl}(x) = \mathscr{R}\, e^{- i k x} \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ \cfrac{-k}{\omega+\mu} \end{array}\right) ~,
    \label{eq1:Diracsolneg}   
\end{align}
while for $x>0$, the transmitted wave function is written as 
\begin{align}
    \psi_\mathrm{trans}(x) = \mathscr{T}\, e^{i q x} \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ \cfrac{q}{ \omega - e V + \mu} \end{array}\right) ~,
    \label{eq1:Diracsolpos} 
\end{align}
where we followed the same procedure as before, obtaining the same results from \eqref{eq1:KGphasev} through \eref{eq1:KGcurrents}. 
Due to the structure of the spinor components, the coefficient in \eqref{eq1:KGr} is modified to
\begin{align}
    r = \mathrm{sgn}(\omega - e V) \frac{\omega+\mu}{\omega-e V+\mu} \sqrt{\frac{(\omega - e V)^2 - \mu^2}{\omega^2 - \mu^2}} ~,
    \label{eq1:Diracr} 
\end{align}
and now, in the same region, $\omega > \mu$, superradiance does not occur.

Even though superradiance and spontaneous pair creation are two distinct phenomena, this result is usually interpreted using the latter, from a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) stand point. 
All incident particles are completely reflected, as well as some extra due to pair creation at the barrier as a result of stimulation by the incident radiation and the presence of a strong electromagnetic field, while the resultant anti-particles are transmitted in the opposite direction, accounting for the change of sign in the transmitted current in \eqref{eq1:KGcurrents}, owing to the opposite charge they carry. 
This also explains the undamped transmission part.

One may think that this difference between bosons and fermions arises from the potential barrier shape, but work by other authors \cite{Sauter1931,Manogue1988,Winter1959} shows that only the difference between the asymptotic values of the potential at infinity is essential for the process. 
The difference comes from intrinsic properties of these particles. 
The amount of fermion pairs produced in a given state, \emph{i.e.} for a given $\omega$, is limited by Pauli's exclusion principle, while such limitation does not occur for bosons \cite{Brito2015}. 
Additionally, fermionic current densities are always positive definite, while bosons can change sign because of the ambiguity in the wave function describing positive and negative energy solutions. 

The minimum necessary energy for this to occur, $2\mu$, leaves evidence that superradiance is accompanied with spontaneous pair creation and some sort of dissipation by the battery maintaining the strong electromagnetic potential, in order to maintain energy balance.
